# Jester Scribe

Ever wondered what it would be like if the local jester of the town had a newsletter? This would be it.


*Jester Scribe* sends you a joke every day and prints it on thermal paper. Ready to take with you through the day, to delight your friends and colleagues with today's joke.


This project is based on the "Scribe" project by UrbanCircles.
